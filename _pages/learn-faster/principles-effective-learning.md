These are common themes that will appear throughout the entire process of approaching and navigating the learning curve - this represents the 20% that make up 80% of learning.

## Observe Without Judging

Avoid putting value judgements on things. Instead, learn to objectively observe reality as it it without ego or emotion. Focus on what you can control, which are your own thoughts and reactions. As long as something does not impair your functioning, your thoughts and how you react to things are in your control. This is a core principle of stoicism that also applies to learning new skills.

> The first skill to learn is the art of letting go the human inclination to judge ourselves and our performance as either good or bad... What I mean by judgment is the act of assigning a negative or positive value to an event... The umpire, here ironically called the judge, doesn't judge the event as positive or negative; he simply sees the ball land and calls it out. [^inner-game]

Learn to objectively observe your thoughts and your performance from a distance with a third person perspective, without judgement. This applies for both good and bad judgementâ€”just observe and notice. Create space between receiving information and formulating a response. Acknowledge your thoughts and sit with them, eventually letting them go without judgement.

> I have said that this recognition should be done without judgement: both feelings of compassion and irritation should be welcomed, recognised and treated on a absolutely equal basis, because both are us. When we are possessed by a sadness, an anxiety, a hatred, or a passion, or whatever, we may find the method of pure observation and recognition difficult to practise, in which case it is helpful to turn to the method of Meditation on a Fixed Object, using our very state of mind as the subject of meditation, as this meditation reveals and heals. [^miracle-mindfulness]

This kind of self-awareness is important not only for ourselves looking inwards, but also looking outwards at others. Try not to place value judgements on other people, but rather just observe what they do. See reality as it is without ego or emotion.

## Errors Are Required to Stimulate Neuroplasticity

From birth to age 25, mere exposure to a sensory event can create plasticity, good or bad. After age 25, neuroplasticity starts to decline. Although neuroplasticity is still possible throughout life after age 25, it is gated by neurochemical processes [^huberman-episode-6].

The key to generating plasticity is the making of errors. When learning a new skill, lean into the errors that you make, and stick with something a little past when you would normally give up. Learn to associate a good feeling with making errors. This kind of failure is good, and is a signal to change and improve [^huberman-episode-7].

Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first chemical that is released during states of high alertness and increases chances of neurons being active. Acetylcholine amplifies sensory input signals and increases signal to noise for that sensory input - it acts as a spotlight [^huberman-episode-6].
